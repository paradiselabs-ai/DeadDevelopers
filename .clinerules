# TDD and AI Code Generation

AI-powered code generation is like hiring an intern with a PhD in syntax but
zero experience debugging production issues. It writes code blazingly fast,
but whether that code works as intended — or even compiles — can be a
complete gamble. Enter Test-Driven Development (TDD), the unsung hero
that ensures AI-generated code isn’t just fancy autocomplete but an actual
working solution.

##he “Double-Entry Bookkeeping” of TDD

Imagine if accountants just eyeballed transactions without double-checking
their books. That’s what coding without TDD feels like. TDD mirrors the
discipline of double-entry bookkeeping — each functionality is written twice:
once as a test (defining expected behavior) and then as actual code (making
it work). The test must pass, or the books don’t balance.

## The TDD Cycle

Here’s the classic TDD cycle:

Red: Write a test that fails (because the functionality doesn’t exist yet).
Green: Write the simplest code to pass the test.
Refactor: Clean up the code while keeping tests green.

This forces accuracy and ensures that AI-generated code is verified before it
ever ships. Without it, you’re just hoping AI got it right — good luck with that.

# AI + TDD: A Necessary Pairing

AI coding assistants like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer,
and Tabnine are great at churning out code snippets. But they don’t
understand the nuances of your application, security constraints, or edge
cases. Without tests, AI is like a student guessing multiple-choice answers —
it might get lucky, but you wouldn’t trust it with your production database.

# The Risks of AI Code Without TDD

Inaccuracy: AI-generated code can be syntactically correct but
logically flawed.
Edge Cases: AI might miss negative numbers, large inputs, or Unicode
characters.
Over-Complexity: AI sometimes over-engineers simple solutions.
Security Issues: AI won’t warn you about SQL injection if you forget to
sanitize input.
A real-world example: Asking AI for a factorial function might yield this:

def factorial(n):
if n == 0 or n == 1:
return 1
return n * factorial(n-1)

Looks fine, right? Until you call factorial(1000) and crash your program
with a stack overflow. A proper test suite would have caught this.


How to Catch the Stack Overflow with TDD

Step 1: Define the Requirements with Tests

Before even touching the code, write tests that specify what the factorial
function should do. You want to cover:

Base cases (0 and 1)

Small positive inputs (e.g., 5)

Larger inputs (e.g., 20, 100, 1000) to test scalability

Negative numbers (should it fail or handle them?)


Using Python’s pytest, here’s a starting test suite:

import pytest
def test_factorial_zero():
assert factorial(0) == 1
def test_factorial_one():
assert factorial(1) == 1
def test_factorial_small():
assert factorial(5) == 120 # 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
def test_factorial_larger():
assert factorial(20) == 2432902008176640000 # 20! is a known value
def test_factorial_very_large():
assert factorial(1000) != 0 # 1000! is huge, just ensure it comput
def test_factorial_negative():
with pytest.raises(ValueError):
factorial(-1)

At this stage, factorial doesn’t exist, so all tests fail (red phase). This is
your "first entry" in the double-entry bookkeeping analogy—defining the
expected behavior.

Step 2: Run the AI-Generated Code
Now, implement the AI’s recursive solution:

def factorial(n):
if n == 0 or n == 1:
return 1
return n * factorial(n-1)

Run the tests:

test_factorial_zero: Passes (1)
test_factorial_one: Passes (1)
test_factorial_small: Passes (120)
test_factorial_larger: Passes (20! computes fine)
test_factorial_very_large: Fails with RecursionError: maximum
recursion depth exceeded
test_factorial_negative: Fails (no ValueError, just infinite recursion)

The RecursionError for factorial(1000) is your smoking gun. Without the
test suite, you might’ve assumed the code was fine for small inputs and
shipped it, only to crash in production when someone tries a big number.
The failing test is the "imbalance" in your bookkeeping—time to fix the
second entry (the code).

Step 3: Fix the Code (Green Phase)
To handle large inputs, switch to an iterative approach, which avoids stack
overflow. Also, add input validation for negatives:

def factorial(n):
if not isinstance(n, int):
raise TypeError("Input must be an integer")
if n < 0:
raise ValueError("Factorial not defined for negative numbers")
if n == 0 or n == 1:
return 1
result = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
result *= i
return result

Run the tests again:
All pass, including factorial(1000) (it computes a massive number
without crashing).
The negative test passes with the expected ValueError.
This iterative version scales better because it doesn’t pile up recursive calls.
For factorial(1000), the result is a monstrously large integer (about 2568
digits), but it computes without issue.

Step 4: Refactor and Verify

You could optimize further — e.g., using math.prod in Python 3.8+ for cleaner
multiplication:

from math import prod
def factorial(n):
if not isinstance(n, int):
raise TypeError("Input must be an integer")
if n < 0:
raise ValueError("Factorial not defined for negative numbers")
if n == 0 or n == 1:
return 1
return prod(range(2, n + 1))

Rerun the suite — still green. The “books” balance: tests and code align
perfectly.

Why This Works

The test suite catches the stack overflow because:

Large Input Test: test_factorial_very_large pushes the function
beyond the recursion limit (1000 in Python by default). Recursive calls
stack up, and Python throws a RecursionError when it hits the limit.
Early Detection: Writing tests first forces you to think about edge
cases (large numbers, negatives) before coding, exposing flaws in the
AI’s naive solution.

Cross-Checking: Like double-entry bookkeeping, the test
(factorial(1000) != 0) and the code’s behavior must match. The
recursive version fails this check, signaling a problem.
Without TDD, you might test manually with factorial(5) and call it a day,
missing the crash at factorial(1000) until a user triggers it. The test suite
acts as your auditor, ensuring no discrepancies slip through.

Stress-Testing the Limits
For fun, let’s push it further. Python handles big integers natively, but what
about factorial(10000)? The iterative version still works (though it takes a
moment—about 0.1 seconds on a decent machine), producing a number with
over 35,000 digits. The recursive version would’ve died at 1000 calls,
proving TDD’s value in forcing scalable solutions.
To quantify this, Python’s recursion limit can be checked with
sys.getrecursionlimit() (default 1000) and raised with
sys.setrecursionlimit(), but that’s a band-aid—iterative is the real fix. A
test like this could confirm performance:

import time
def test_factorial_performance():
start = time.time()
factorial(1000)
assert time.time() - start < 1, "Should compute 1000! in under 1 se

Test-Driven Generation (TDG): AI Works for You

TDD isn’t just for verifying AI — it can directly guide AI in writing better
code. This approach, called Test-Driven Generation (TDG), involves writing
tests first and then prompting AI to generate code that passes them. Instead
of asking AI for “a function that checks if a number is even,” you write tests
first:

def test_is_even():
assert is_even(2) is True
assert is_even(3) is False
assert is_even(-4) is True
assert is_even(0) is True

Then you let AI generate the function. If it fails, AI tries again — ensuring AI
writes correct code, not just fast code.

AI + TDD vs. AI Without TDD

AI is Fast, but TDD is Your Seatbelt

Skipping TDD while coding with AI is like letting a self-driving car hit the
highway without testing its brakes first. It might be fine, or it might go full
speed into a wall. With TDD, you ensure AI-generated code isn’t just fast, but
also correct, reliable, and maintainable.
In the age of AI coding assistants, TDD isn’t optional — it’s a survival skill. So,
if you don’t want to spend your debugging hours cursing at an AI-generated
infinite loop, write your tests first. Future-you will thank you.
