# DeadDevelopers Community Platform

A community platform for developers who use AI for 80%+ of their workflow. Built with FastHTML, Django, and Vercel.

## About

From [© ParadiseLabs](https://github.com/paradiselabs-ai)

**_DeadDevelopers_** is an open-source collective for the post-human coder.

It's a community for the "dead" developers - like me! - who now build software with AI doing most (~80%) of the heavy lifting, if not more. Whether you're a beginner who starting using AI to skip tutorial purgatory, or a seasoned dev who (reluctantly, perhaps) stopped pretending, and can admit that Copilot and the [Cline](url) extension is your senior engineer, welcome.

### Why "dead"?

Because if you’re not automating 80% of your workflow, you’re either lying or working twice as hard. We’re now the actual ghosts in the machine – debugging code hallucinations, refining prompts like incantations, and knowing when to CTRL+Z an AI’s “creative” solutions.

We're not about blindly copying AI output—there's actually an art to getting AI to build what you envision instead of what it thinks you want. **Join Us** if:

- You have frequently corrected (argued with) an AI about its code solutions
- Your "coding" involves more natural language than code
- You've deployed projects written 90% by AI - but with lots of orchestration and refining (and often having to fetch previous version's of a file from your IDE's timeline)

If this describes your everyday workflow - _you'll fit right in_
