# Development Notes

## Hero Section Implementation (LOCKED - DO NOT MODIFY)

The hero section has been perfected with the following key elements:

### Animated Code Editor
- Terminal-style window with green border accents
- Line numbers and syntax highlighting
- Animated typing effect for code appearance
- Blinking cursor effect
- Perfect timing on line-by-line reveal

### Typography & Layout
- "HUMANS (MOSTLY) NOT REQUIRED" in bold, impactful typography
- Monospace tagline: "Where AI writes 80% of your code, and you're proud of it."
- Clean button layout with "START BUILDING WITH AI" and "SEE HOW IT WORKS"

### Visual Effects
- Subtle grid background with opacity 0.1
- Gradient overlays for depth
- Terminal-style code window with perfect padding and spacing
- Syntax highlighting colors:
  - Comments: #6a9955 (green)
  - Function declarations: #dcdcaa (yellow)
  - Strings: #ce9178 (orange)
  - Keywords: #569cd6 (blue)
  - Function calls: #4ec9b0 (teal)

### Critical CSS Components
```css
/* These styles are locked and should not be modified */
.animated-editor {
    width: 600px;
    max-width: 90%;
    margin: 0 auto 3rem;
    position: relative;
}

.code-window {
    background: var(--terminal);
    border-radius: 2px;
    padding: 2.5rem 1.5rem 1.5rem;
    /* Box shadow creates the perfect terminal border effect */
    box-shadow: 
        0 2px 0 var(--primary),
        0 -2px 0 var(--primary),
        2px 0 0 var(--primary),
        -2px 0 0 var(--primary);
    border: none;
}

.code-lines > span {
    /* Animation timing is crucial for readability */
    animation: fadeInLine 0.1s ease-out forwards;
}

/* Animation delays create the perfect typing effect */
.code-lines > span:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0.1s; }
.code-lines > span:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }
.code-lines > span:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.5s; }
.code-lines > span:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.7s; }
.code-lines > span:nth-child(5) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }
.code-lines > span:nth-child(6) { animation-delay: 1.1s; }
.code-lines > span:nth-child(7) { animation-delay: 1.3s; }
.code-lines > span:nth-child(8) { animation-delay: 1.5s; }
.code-lines > span:nth-child(9) { animation-delay: 1.7s; }
```

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES
1. The hero section's implementation is now LOCKED. Any proposed changes must go through thorough review.
2. The animated code effect is perfectly timed - do not modify the animation delays.
3. The color scheme and syntax highlighting create the perfect terminal feel.
4. The layout spacing and proportions are optimized for both desktop and mobile.

### Future Considerations
- The hero section should remain untouched
- Only bug fixes or critical performance improvements should be considered
- Any proposed changes must maintain the exact same visual and animated effects
- The timing of the code animation is crucial for readability and impact

## Navigation Implementation
- Logo and brand text properly styled
- Hover effects with voltage glow
- Mobile menu with backdrop blur
- Smooth transitions for all interactions

## Next Steps
1. Focus on implementing remaining sections while maintaining the same level of polish
2. Ensure all new features maintain consistent terminal/code aesthetic
3. Document any new animations or effects in similar detail
