# Current Development Stage

## Project Status: Early Development
- Hero section complete and locked
- Navigation complete
- Authentication system 100% complete (email verification and GitHub OAuth added)
- Dashboard UI 50% complete
- Moving into community features next

## Established Design Language
- Terminal/Code/Post-Punk/Raw-Industrial aesthetic
- High contrast with neon accents
- Monospace typography
- Animated terminal effects
- Industrial grid patterns
- Raw, edgy UI elements

## Core Color Palette
```css
--acid: #00ff66;        /* Digital acid green */
--voltage: #7df9ff;     /* Electric blue */
--terminal: #1a1a1a;    /* Terminal black */
--steel: #2b2b2b;       /* Dark steel */
```

## Design Principles
1. Embrace the Terminal
   - Code-like interfaces
   - Command-line inspired interactions
   - Monospace fonts for impact

2. Raw Industrial Feel
   - Exposed grid systems
   - Mechanical transitions
   - "Unfinished" aesthetic
   - Visible structure

3. Post-Punk Elements
   - High contrast
   - Glitch effects
   - Asymmetrical layouts
   - Bold typography

4. Interactive Polish
   - Smooth animations
   - Responsive feedback
   - Terminal-style typing effects
   - Glowing accents

## Current Focus
1. Authentication System Testing
   - Comprehensive testing of all auth flows
   - Performance optimization
   - Form validation refinement
   - Email verification and GitHub OAuth implemented and working

2. Community Features Planning
   - Chat room architecture
   - Forum system design
   - Code snippet sharing
   - Real-time update system

## Technical Standards
- Mobile-first approach
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility compliance
- Clean, documented code

## Next Milestones
1. Complete auth system
2. Refine navigation
3. Begin community features
4. Expand documentation

## Notes
- Hero section serves as quality benchmark
- Maintain consistent industrial/terminal aesthetic
- Focus on user experience within design constraints
- Document all new patterns and components
