   - Moderation tools

3. **Content Publishing**
   - Blog/Article creation
   - Markdown support
   - Code block formatting
   - Draft system
   - Social features (likes, comments, shares)

4. **Activity Feeds**
   - Main global feed
   - Custom feeds (articles, blogs, posts from chosen sources)
   - User activity updates
   - Project updates
   - Community highlights

5. **Code Snippet Sharing**
