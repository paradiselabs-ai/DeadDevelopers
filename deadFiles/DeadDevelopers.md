**DeadDevelopers Community Description**  

DeadDevelopers is a place for people who build software with AI doing most of the heavy lifting. It’s not about replacing developers but leaning into the reality that modern coding often looks like directing, debugging, and refining AI-generated code. The name plays on the joke that if AI writes 80% of your code, you’re technically a "dead" developer—but here, that’s worn as a badge of pragmatism, not shame.  

The community is geared toward two groups:  
1. **Newcomers** using AI to break into development without traditional coding expertise.  
2. **Veterans** who’ve adopted AI as a core part of their workflow, not just a novelty.  

It’s less about hype and more about the grind: sharing prompts that actually work, troubleshooting AI’s weird code hallucinations, and figuring out how to stay relevant when Copilot can generate a REST API in 10 seconds. There’s no judgment if your “coding” looks like arguing with GPT-4 to fix a loop it wrote wrong.  

The tools and discussions here focus on:  
- **Practical collaboration**: Real-time pairing with AI, not just theory.  
- **Unpolished workflows**: Sharing scripts that automate the tedious parts of working with AI.  
- **Adaptation**: What happens when your AI toolchain breaks, updates, or gets paywalled.  

The name is intentionally jarring—a reminder that clinging to “how things used to be” is a dead end. This isn’t a utopia; it’s a workshop for people who’ve accepted that AI is now part of the job.


**Twitter/X Version**  
DeadDevelopers: For devs who treat AI like a junior partner—write most of the code, make most of the mistakes. We share prompts that actually work, troubleshoot weird code hallucinations, and figure out how to stay relevant when Copilot writes APIs 98% faster than you can. 

**GitHub Repo Description**  
`DeadDevelopers Community
Python-based tools for developers integrating AI into ≥80% of their workflow. Includes:  
- FastHTML WebSocket chat for real-time AI pairing  
- Session-based AI usage tracking  
- Django extensions for GPT-4 code challenge systems  
Contributions welcome—especially if your PRs start with “So I told GPT to…”  

**LinkedIn Post**  
Building software in 2025 often means directing AI more than writing code. DeadDevelopers is a community for developers navigating that shift:  
- **Newcomers**: Using AI to break into dev without traditional backgrounds  
- **Veterans**: Scaling their impact by treating AI as a copilot, not a crutch  
We’re open-sourcing tools to make AI collaboration less fragile. If your “debugging” is often just arguing with a language model, you’ll fit right in.  

**Discord Server Welcome**  
`#welcome`  
This is where AI writes the code and we clean up the mess.  
- Share prompts that actually worked  
- Vent about AI’s nonsensical variable names  
- Debate whether “AI developer” is an oxymoron  
Channel rules: No low-effort “what’s the best AI tool?” posts. We’re here to make the tools we have *work*, not chase hype.  

**Mastodon/Threads**  
DeadDevelopers isn’t about replacing programmers—it’s about surviving the reality that AI writes better code at 2 AM than you do. Join if:  
- Your “coding” is mostly prompt engineering  
- You’ve debugged an LLM's syntax errors more than your own  
- You need a place to rant when GitHub Copilot suggests `def do_the_thing():` for the 10th time
